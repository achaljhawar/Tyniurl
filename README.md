<h3 align="center">A hassle free URL shortner.</h3>

This is a simple responsive URL shortner that I made for Halolegion inductions. You can use it and make it yours by changing things and colors to your style and liking! I made it with a lot of hard work, love and of course with code :) I'm not a professional coder, but i tried my best to make it look cool and yet still keep it simple. While working with JS i got many errors, but thanks to Youtube Tutorials for helping me fix them. Also thanks to <a href="htttps://utkarsh.co">Utkarsh</a> for some hosting support :D. And pls view the properly indented code at https://repl.it/@AchalJhawar/Tyni

Mistakes are proof that we are trying!

I learned so much while making this template, if you use it, please let me know. I would love to see how amazing people can make it! I hope you'll like it!

<b>I have used:</b>

- exspressjs for markup
- Bootstrap CDN for styling
- A lot of JS for building the server and stuff
- Shortid for generating codes for shorturls
- Nodemon for devlopment

You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it. Have a nice day! :D

So to use my app you need to download some dependencies and clone my repository. As I am facing problem to find a alternative other than nodemon to do web hosting pls share me a way it would really help.
